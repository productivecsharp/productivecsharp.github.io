</pre>
<h2>4. AGE RESTRICTION</h2>
<pre>
You shall not purchase any services or products from our sites if you are below the age of 18 years old because under this age, you do not have legal capacity to enter into a contract.

<h2>5. ACCEPTANCE OF ORDER</h2>
<pre>
5.1 These Terms will become binding on you and us and a Contract will come into effect between you and us only upon our written acceptance of the order issued to you by email (Email Confirmation) or when we contact you to tell you that we are able to provide the services or products to you. We are not bound by the order unless we accept it in writing.

5.2 If there is any conflict between these Terms and any term of the order, the order will take priority.
</pre>
<h2>6. ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h2>

These Terms and the Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and us and supersedes all previous agreements, promises, assurances, warranties, representations and understandings between us, whether written or oral, relating to its subject matter.
</pre>
<h2>7. REPRESENTATIONS</h2>

7.2 You shall not have any claim for innocent or negligent misrepresentation against us based on any statement in this Contract.

<h2>8. PROVISION OF SERVICES</h2>
<pre>
8.1 We will supply the services to you from the date set out in the order for a period until the estimated completion date set out in the order.

8.2 We will make every effort to complete the services on time. However, there may be delays due to an Event Outside Our Control. See clause 14 below for our responsibilities when an Event Outside Our Control happens.

8.3 We may have to suspend the services if we have to deal with technical problems, or to make improvements agreed between you and us in writing to the services. We will contact you to let you know in advance where this occurs, unless the problem is urgent or an emergency. You do not have to pay for the services while they are suspended under this clause 8.4 but this does not affect your obligation to pay for any invoices we have already sent you.

8.4 If you do not pay us for the services when you are supposed to, we may suspend the services with immediate effect until you have paid us the outstanding amounts (except where you validly dispute an invoice). We will contact you to tell you this. This does not affect our right to charge you interest.

8.5 If we design a product for you or supply a product to you as part of the services (such as a report, a CD, a DVD, an e-book or any other form of digital content or any other type of product whatsoever), we will own the copyright, design right and all other intellectual property rights in such product and any drafts, drawings or illustrations we make in connection with the product for you.

9.2 As a consumer, you have legal rights in relation to services not carried out with reasonable skill and care, or if the materials we use are faulty or not as described.

9.3 Before we begin to provide the services, you have the following rights to cancel our services:

a) you may cancel any order for Services at any time before the start date for the services by sending a mail to andrea.angella@productivecsharp.com. We will confirm your cancellation in writing to you;

b) if you cancel an Order under clause 9.3 (a) and you have made any payment in advance for services that have not been provided to you, we will refund these amounts to you;

c) however, if you cancel an order for services and we have already started work on your order by that time, you will pay us any costs we reasonably incurred in starting to fulfil the order, and this charge will be deducted from any refund that is due to you or, if no refund is due to you, invoiced to you. We will tell you what these costs are when you contact us. However, where you have cancelled an order because of our failure to comply with these Terms (except where we have been affected by an Event Outside Our Control), you do not have to make any payment to us.

we change these Terms under to your material disadvantage;

we are affected by an Event Outside Our Control.

<h2>12. PRICE AND PAYMENT</h2>
<pre>
12.1 Prices of the services and products are specified on our sites and confirmed on the checkout page. We may change our prices any time, but that will not affect the prices for confirmed orders.

12.2 Our prices are inclusive of VAT. However, if there is a change in the rate of VAT between the date of the order and the date of delivery or performance, the rate of VAT that you pay will be adjusted, unless you have already paid full purchase price prior to the change in the rate of VAT takes effect.

12.3 Despite our best efforts, there may be incorrect prices on some of the services or products. If the correct price is less than a price shown on our sites, the lower amount will be charged. If the correct price is higher than the price specified on our sites, we will inform you of this and ask whether you wish to continue with the order with the actual higher price. If the error in price is obvious, unmistakeable and mispricing could have been recognised reasonably by you, we will not be liable to provide the services or products to you at the lower price that was incorrect.

12.4 Payment for services is to be made in advance by credit or debit card (using Stripe) except where agreed otherwise in writing between us.

12.5 If you do not make any payment due to us by the due date for payment, we may charge interest to you on the overdue amount at the rate of 3% a year above the base lending rate of HSBC from time to time. This interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until the date of actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. You must pay us interest together with any overdue amount.
